- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    Class components allow for the use of lifecycle events. The events seem easier to manipulate useing class componenets. 
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    ComponentDidMount- Sets up the whold lifecycle and render process. Set initial "setting" on the DOM
    componentDidUpdate- The component "cycles" looking for imputs and changes. When the changes occur, the DOM is updated.
    componentDidUnmount- RIP component. 
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    To be this weeks bane of my existence. Sets a key and initial value that can effect different parts of the DOM. You can control different parts of the DOM by triggering events that use hooks. 
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    Because hooks were not enough of a pain this week. We test apps to improve reliability over a bigger scale. You can either run a ton of test and have super stable code, but updates and improvements will take longer. You can do more basic testing and not restrict the devs as much. It all depends on the project that you work on.
